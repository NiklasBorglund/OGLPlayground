An OpenGL playground environment which I'll use to try new things, learn new techniques, create small projects etc..

I'm using the following libraries(Which you'll need to download and install for the project to compile & run):
SOIL - http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html
GLFW - http://www.glfw.org/
GLEW - http://glew.sourceforge.net/
AssImp - http://assimp.sourceforge.net/
